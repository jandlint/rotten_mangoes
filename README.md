# Rotten Mangoes

A Lighthouse Labs Rails exercise. It's pretty much Rotten Tomatoes.

Fundamental site functions are explored using Rails tools:

* Adding, commenting and voting of posts
* User management via admin
* Form validations
* User sessions

It's as if it was made in a time before CSS was invented.
